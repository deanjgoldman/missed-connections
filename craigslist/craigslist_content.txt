If possible, new members meet up with the party host to discuss their request to join the next party.

We look for more White, Latin, European, Asian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino and Thai play friends. ', u'\n', u'\nEach attendee can accept or decline to be with any partner so this is a non pressure environment to play in. Some men enjoy two women at once. Some women enjoy having one guy at a time and the guys take turns, some women enjoy the pleasure of oral, vaginal and anal sex as well as dp (double penetration sex). If she wants it all we can do airtight, a man of her choice man in mouth, pussy and ass. It is totally up to the woman. Of course we can also do one on one sex and try many positions you both like.

[u'\n        ', u'\nI have posted a couple of true casual encounter stories, real, and happened as described. Recently a married woman was traveling into NYC for a two days for business, staying in a nice mid-town hotel. Said she never really did anything outside of her marriage, but felt like being in a big city in a different state helped her more at ease... she had found a post I had put up about watching me masturbate and said she watched masturbation porn and found it really hot... she didn\'t want to "go all the way" but she wanted me to come over to her hotel room and act like it was my own...', u'\n', u"\nshe wanted me to come in after a day of work, make a drink, strip out of my work cloths and take a shower... She would be sitting in the chair in the corner and didn't want to say anything... just watch me and have me pretend she wasn't there... as I was getting into the shower I could see in the reflection of the mirror she had gotten up and was watching from the door... I took a nice long, warm shower, lots of soap, lathering up so to say... occasionally stroking my cock as I was getting hard from the thrill of her watching me... she was wearing the hotel robe and I could see that she had opened the front and was gently touching herself. When I got out of the shower I could see that she had moved back away from the door... I hadn't really made any eye contact trying to maintain the scene so I had not seen that she had taken off the robe and was back on the chair sitting naked.", u'\n', u"\nShe had said in her email she wanted to watch me masturbate and I could watch the in-room porn... I pushed some pillow up against the headboard and leaned back with my cock in my hands and started watching really bad porn, but I was still turned on by the idea she just wanted to be watch me. She was sitting right next to the bed, I don't remember how long I kept watching the porn and ignoring her... I was making constant side glances and could see she was an incredibly attractive woman (hot petite soccer mom), but I finally turned and looked at her, watching her play with herself as she was watching me...", u'\n', u'\nShe asked if she could touch it and my grin pretty much said yes. I moved over on the bed and she laid down next to me spreading her legs so one was crossed over one of mine. Were were lying next to each other and she reached over and started stroking my cock while I started to play with her breasts and nipples... sliding my hands down, feeling how hot and wet her pussy was. She stroked my cock while I circled her clit with my fingers... she came first... it a cute short moan but one that was distinctive of a nice orgasm... as she was recovering she was still stroking my cock and asked me if I was ready to cum... it was going to be soon... she continues to stroke my cock and started talking dirty... telling me she wanted me to cum on her tits and she wanted to feel my warm cum dripping on her skin... when I came it was a huge burst all across her chest... s', u'\n', u'\nThere is that awkwardness when you have to make that small talk as you are cleaning up and getting dressed, but it was pretty laid back... she admitted that this would be a one time thrill for her and she was nothing like this back home... she stayed naked and as I was finishing getting dressed gave me a big deep kiss, shaking her boobs at me laughing pointing at all the cum that was drying on her, said good bye and went off to take a shower as I left.

[u'\n        ', u'\nHi, ever notice that:', u'\n', u"\n1. It's pretty common nowadays to see an asian girl with a guy of another race, right? So when you see a pair, no big deal.

So when you see one, it's still pretty surprising and interesting.", u'\n', u"\nI am sure you won't disagree with those two statements. Ok good. Now put those together in your mind. Do you see what that means? This: The vast majority of these guys don't stick around. Ok, another thought exercise for you-", u'\n', u'\n3. 99% of guys look at porn. Especially now with the internet offering everything for free.', u"\n4.

The biggest industry (really almost the only industry) outside of Western porn, is Japan's", u'\n', u'\nYou know what I\'m about to say next- put these three statements together. That\'s right, 99% of guys have therefore seen Asian porn. 99% of guys out there have thought of banging an Asian girl. "But...no, not my guy, he\'s different," you\'re thinking. Is he though? Ask yourself, do you think he has seen pornography? Ask yourself, why are there SO many guys are there looking for Asian women- the varied range of adolescents to old, elderly men (ok, I won\'t mention the pedophiles who go to Thailand), from the preppy guy, to rough around the edges guy, to the dorky nerd- is there one point of commonality among all of them? (whispers) It\'s porn. Of course, there are many more factors behind their fixation (sexual stereotypes, insecurities about their height/penis size, the perceived lack of competition with Asian men), but pornography is the first and perhaps biggest driver of them all. If, in some alternate universe, the Australian Aborigine porn industry was churning out a serious amount of material, you can bet all these guys would be trying to hook up with one.', u'\n', u'\nSo, Asian Girl.

She would be sitting in the chair in the corner and didn't want to say anything... just watch me and have me pretend she wasn't there... as I was getting into the shower I could see in the reflection of the mirror she had gotten up and was watching from the door... I took a nice long, warm shower, lots of soap, lathering up so to say... occasionally stroking my cock as I was getting hard from the thrill of her watching me... she was wearing the hotel robe and I could see that she had opened the front and was gently touching herself. When I got out of the shower I could see that she had moved back away from the door... I hadn't really made any eye contact trying to maintain the scene so I had not seen that she had taken off the robe and was back on the chair sitting naked.", u'\n', u"\nShe had said in her email she wanted to watch me masturbate and I could watch the in-room porn... I pushed some pillow up against the headboard and leaned back with my cock in my hands and started watching really bad porn, but I was still turned on by the idea she just wanted to be watch me. She was sitting right next to the bed, I don't remember how long I kept watching the porn and ignoring her... I was making constant side glances and could see she was an incredibly attractive woman (hot petite soccer mom), but I finally turned and looked at her, watching her play with herself as she was watching me...", u'\n', u'\nShe asked if she could touch it and my grin pretty much said yes. I moved over on the bed and she laid down next to me spreading her legs so one was crossed over one of mine. Were were lying next to each other and she reached over and started stroking my cock while I started to play with her breasts and nipples... sliding my hands down, feeling how hot and wet her pussy was. She stroked my cock while I circled her clit with my fingers... she came first... it a cute short moan but one that was distinctive of a nice orgasm... as she was recovering she was still stroking my cock and asked me if I was ready to cum... it was going to be soon... she continues to stroke my cock and started talking dirty... telling me she wanted me to cum on her tits and she wanted to feel my warm cum dripping on her skin... when I came it was a huge burst all across her chest... s', u'\n', u'\nThere is that awkwardness when you have to make that small talk as you are cleaning up and getting dressed, but it was pretty laid back... she admitted that this would be a one time thrill for her and she was nothing like this back home... she stayed naked and as I was finishing getting dressed gave me a big deep kiss, shaking her boobs at me laughing pointing at all the cum that was drying on her, said good bye and went off to take a shower as I left.
